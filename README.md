# tb_ultra_performance
with Alberto Garcia Basteiro

- New project in January
- Active case finding for household members of hospital-diagnosed index TB cases
- AFP smear (microscopy: 1, 2, or 3) vs. 
- culture (liquid and solid, the former is faster and more expensive, look at TTP: time to positivity; the longer the time it takes to become positive, the lower the bacillary load) vs.
- GeneXpert: same day
- Xpert Ultra: way more sensitive.

- Nobody has yet looked at correlation of bacillary load with samples
- How to measure bacillary load with xpert: CT values (cycle threshold values): number of times that PCR needs to do amplification of original DNA in sample until it is detected - the higher the cycle threshold (10-40) the lower the amount of DNA that was in that sample

- We are going to compare the AFP smear with TTP of the culture with the CT of both experts. And we're going to look at correlations (whether they are well correlated or not).

- Xpert Ultra is going to substitute traditoinal expert (matter of time).
- Patients were isolated in hospitals based on results of AFP smear
- Does Xpert Ultra correlate well in terms? What is the appropriate threshold (ie, try at different ones)
- Xpert provides semi-quantitative scale of bacillary load (very low, low, medium, high)

- Trace call: cases where DNA is so little that it can't even provide results for resisistance (ie, sometimes found in already treated patients or non-active patients)

Trying to find:
1. Diagnostic performance of Ultra
2. Correlation with other measures
3. Cut-off depending on unit of positivity (ie, the point at which 95% of AFP+ and GeneXpert+ are identified by Ultra)
